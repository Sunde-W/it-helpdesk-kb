# PowerShell Automation Basics  
*Automate routine tasks with PowerShell:*  

1. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator.  
2. Use `Get-Help` to explore cmdlets, e.g., `Get-Help Get-Service`.  
3. Create a simple script file (e.g., `script.ps1`) and add commands such as `Get-Service | Out-File services.txt`.  
4. Run a script by typing `./script.ps1` in PowerShell.  
5. To schedule scripts, use Task Scheduler: create a new task, choose your script, and set trigger times.
