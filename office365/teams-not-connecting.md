# Teams Not Connecting  
*If Microsoft Teams cannot connect or shows "We're sorry—we've run into an issue".*  
  
1. Check your internet connection and ensure you can browse other websites.  
2. Quit Teams completely (right-click the icon in the system tray and choose Quit).  
3. Clear Teams cache:  
   - On Windows, press `Win+R`, type `%appdata%\Microsoft\Teams` and delete contents of the folder.  
   - On Mac, delete `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams` cache directories.  
4. Restart Teams and sign in again.  
5. If it still fails, try logging in via the web app at `https://teams.microsoft.com`.  
6. If the web app works, uninstall and reinstall the Teams desktop app.  
7. Ensure your account and password are correct and that MFA requirements are met.  
8. Contact your IT admin if the issue persists.
